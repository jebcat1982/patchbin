<h2>About</h2>
<p>Patchbin is a better way to send patches to fellow developers on Mailing
lists, IRC etc, and get feedback and reviews. Paste a patch in the GNU Diff
format, and hit "Submit" to get a shortened link to your patch.</p>

<p>To post a comment, double click on the line, and use the form to post
your comment. You can also reply to existing comments.</p>

<p>I built this site as a learning exercise in Django. If you find
something that needs changing or fixing, please email me at ("anirudh@" +
"anirudhs" + "anjeev.org"), I'm still very new to all this. The code is
also on <a href="http://github.com/ninjagod/patchbin">github</a></p>
